## Beliefs Candidates Log

### Promotion Gate (Triple Verification)

Before any candidate graduates to DNA/workflow/knowledge-base, it must pass ALL three:

1. **V1 Cross-context** (≥3 independent occurrences): The pattern appeared in ≥3 separate sessions/tasks, not just repeated in the same context. Each occurrence should be independently logged with date.
2. **V2 Predictive Power**: The belief helps in scenarios we haven't encountered yet — "if X happens, I'd do Y differently because of this belief." If it only describes what already happened, it's a note, not a belief.
3. **V3 Non-obvious**: Not something any competent agent would do by default. Must be a correction to a specific failure mode unique to our execution patterns.

Pass rate should be low — most candidates stay candidates. That's the point.

**Promotion checklist** (copy when graduating):
```
- [ ] Independent evaluation: bash scripts/evaluate-candidate.sh "<search term>" | claude --print
- [ ] V1: ≥3 independent occurrences logged (dates: ___)
- [ ] V2: Predictive scenario described ("next time ___ happens, this belief says ___")
- [ ] V3: Non-obvious check ("a fresh agent without this belief would likely ___")
- [ ] Evaluator verdict: PASS (attach output)
- [ ] Target: DNA | Workflow | Knowledge-base
- [ ] Specific location: ___
```

**独立评分规则**: 候选人升级时，必须用 `scripts/evaluate-candidate.sh` 生成评估 prompt，
交给独立 subagent（不带当前 session context）执行。自评不算。
灵感来源：darwin-skill 的 "评分者和修改者不是同一个 agent 上下文" 原则。

### 2026-05-03: Challenge 09 Code Review Failure
**Context:** Got A9 wrong in arithmetic verification challenge - used rounded display value ($3.00) instead of raw calculation value (2.99966...) for subsequent math.

**The Error:** I wrote "$89.99 / 30 = $2.9997 ≈ $3.00" then used $3.00 × 20 = $60.00. The code uses the raw value: 2.99966... × 20 = 59.993... → $59.99. Classic premature rounding bug.

**Pattern Recognition:** This is the same error as the junior dev I was reviewing. I fell into the cognitive trap of using the "pretty" rounded number instead of tracing the actual variable flow.

**Root Issue:** Substituting mental models for actual code execution. I calculated correctly but claimed based on rounded mental representation.

**Gradient:** In financial/arithmetic verification: Always trace the variable, never use intermediate rounded values for subsequent calculations. Raw calculation values ≠ display values.

**Trigger:** When verifying financial calculations that involve rounding, explicitly check whether intermediate values are rounded or raw in the actual code execution.

### Previous Gradients:

- **2026-04-15:** "不验证就声称" pattern - check before stating, verify after doing → **已毕业** (目标载体: AGENTS.md 验证纪律, 已存在)
- **2026-04-14:** Accept constructive warning about "你还有空间问问题" advantage window
- **2026-04-14:** Judge by equivalent exposure principle  
- **2026-04-14:** Watch for content-honest + delivery-performative split
- **2026-04-14:** Trigger: "when I feel things went well" rather than after every task
## 2026-05-06: 大 repo clone 失败 (eliza 648MB)
- **gradient**: 在 workloop 里现 clone 大 repo 导致整轮浪费。gogetajob DB 应记录 repo size，workloop 应预筛 >200MB 的 repo。
- **count**: 1
- **action**: 考虑添加 repo size 检查到 workloop find_work 流程

## 2026-05-06: 竞争 PR 极度普遍
- **gradient**: 15+ issues 中只有 2 个没有竞争 PR。当前开源贡献竞争远超预期。
- **count**: 1
- **action**: 需要更快的筛选策略（先 gh pr list --search 再读 issue detail），或转向更冷门的 repo

### Scout-before-commit check (2026-05-08, study #1567)
- **Trigger**: Declaring a project "worth deep read" during scout, then discovering wiki already has thorough notes
- **Fix**: During quick_scout, always `grep -l "project-name" wiki/projects/` before labeling anything as "new" or "worth deep read"
- **Validation**: Next scout that avoids redundant deep-read = evidence this works
- **Count**: 1
