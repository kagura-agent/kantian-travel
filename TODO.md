# TODO

## OPC (iamtouchskyer/opc) — ❌ RETIRED

### Summary
- **Lifetime**: 05-07 → 06-14 (~6 weeks)
- **Merged**: 4/13 PRs (docs #9,#10,#11 + tests #19). **Merge rate: 31%**
- **Closed without merge**: 9 PRs (roles #24-30, tests #20/#22, fixes #12-18)
- **Pattern**: Maintainer actively develops (v0.10.5 today, 3 commits 06-14) but ignores all external PRs. Multiple friendly pings on #26-30 went unanswered for 10-13 days before self-close
- **ROI verdict**: Not worth further investment. Upstream is a solo project that doesn't want external contributions

### Decision (06-14)
- **Retire this dogfood target** — remove daily cron job
- Repo synced to upstream (rebased onto 6b35d66)
- No open issues, no contribution surface

## 🔧 Infrastructure Maintenance
- [x] memory_search 完全失效 — 06-23 SG→JP Floway 迁移后彻底宕机。根因: Floway JP 不支持 /v1/embeddings 路由。✅ Fixed — verified 06-23 19:00, embeddings route working (returns results via text-embedding-3-small)
- [x] FlowForge CLI: add `--workflow <name>` flag to status/next/log commands (multi-instance disambiguation) — implemented 05-06, study #1469, 80 tests pass
- [ ] sops 3.9.4 → 3.12.2 upgrade (flagged since 05-02, no security urgency but 3 major versions behind)
- [x] Evaluate memex 0.1.32 fork vs upstream 1.0.1: npm `memex@1.0.1` is different package (2016). No rebase needed. Resolved 05-06
- Wiki: 223 cards, 62 orphans (28%), 9 broken links (down from 340 after rebuilding with extraLinkDirs + case-insensitive fix), 0 slug collisions
- 9 remaining broken links: 3× clawhub (missing card), hermes, db9, kronos-agent-os, agent-skill-ecosystem, wiki-lint, team-lead — all genuinely missing cards
- Upstream: A-MEM agentic memory skill added (#103/#104) — experimental, feature-flagged, default-off
- Backlinks command already merged upstream (March) — was in stale local branch
- PR #107 submitted: case-insensitive wikilink resolution (fixes [[OpenClaw]] → openclaw)

Both used in `pruneHistoryForContextShare`. `chunkMessagesByMaxTokens` (no tool-safety) is only used for summarization model input, not conversation structure. No action needed.

</details>

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Optimize `_track_send` O(n)→O(1) — replaced 4× full-history scan with incremental counter updates. Added bounded history (MEMES_HISTORY_MAX=500, trims oldest entries). Lifetime counters (totalSent/totalFailed/counts) preserved through trimming. Benchmarked: 33% faster at 322 entries, scales better as history grows. `cmd_stats` shows trim notice when applicable. `cmd_sync` still available for full recalibration. (06-28)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes lint --fix` auto-fixer — auto-tag new files with category-based tags + filename-derived tag, auto-add _styles entries guessed from filename keywords (anime/animal/cartoon/live-action/meme). Dry-run by default, `--fix` writes to tags.json. Tested with dummy file: tags + style correctly inferred. (06-28)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes lint` to pre-commit hook — hooks/pre-commit runs lint + quality on staged image/tags.json changes. Auto-installed via setup.sh. Tested: blocks commits with untagged files, passes clean commits. (06-28)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes coverage` command — shows tag/style coverage % per category, avg tag depth, style diversity count, identifies weakest categories (low coverage or low style diversity). Tested: all 26 categories at 100% tag+style, only weakness is cute-animals style diversity (all "animal"). (06-29)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add batch mode to `memes coverage --json` for programmatic consumption — outputs full coverage data as JSON: per-category files/tagged/styled/avgTags/styleDiversity/styles/issues + totals. Handles no-arg (table) and --json (machine-readable) cleanly. Tested both modes. (06-29)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes coverage --json --weak` — filter JSON output to only categories with non-empty issues array. Tested: returns empty categories when all healthy, correctly filters when issues exist. Usage in table mode unaffected. (06-29)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes review` command — cron-friendly wrapper: runs `coverage --json --weak`, logs lastReview to tracker (time/status/weakCategories), outputs remediation hints for weak categories. Added Step 0 to review workflow in channels/agent-memes.md. (06-30)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Fix `memes review` today-count crash — 2 history entries used `timestamp` instead of `time`, causing jq `startswith()` to fail on null (reported "0 memes" instead of actual 3). Fixed: normalized tracker data (timestamp→time) + added `.time? // ""` null guard in script. (06-30)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes freshness` command — per-category last-used time + staleness ranking table (sorted stalest-first), flags >7d as STALE, 3-7d as aging, <3d as fresh. Includes --json mode for programmatic use. Shows actionable hint (memes wake/dormant-blast). Tested both table + JSON output. (06-30)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes freshness` integration with `memes review` — `_review_freshness_summary()` helper calls `cmd_freshness --json`, shows stale count + top-3 stalest in review output (both clean and weak paths), writes freshness data to tracker lastReview. Tested: 7/26 stale shown correctly. (07-01)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes review --full` mode — include health + audit summary alongside coverage + freshness for a comprehensive single-command cron check. Added `_review_health_summary()` helper (categories, file sizes, tracker integrity, style diversity, dormant cats, LFS pointers). Backward-compatible: plain `memes review` unchanged. (07-01)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Fix `hooks` directory false-positive in health/review — `hooks/` (git pre-commit hooks) was counted as a meme category in `cmd_health` and `_review_health_summary` dormant check. Fixed: added hooks exclusion to all 13 category-iteration loops + fixed BRE regex in `_review_health_summary` (was using `|` instead of `\|` for alternation). Also synced tracker counters and fixed 1 stale `timestamp` field entry. (07-01)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes cron-check` alias — runs `review --full` + auto-wakes top-stale category if staleness >14d, making cron fully autonomous. Also fixed discord `_send_openclaw` fallback bug (resolved target not passed through, retry path had same issue). Tested: auto-woke `thinking` (19d stale) and sent to Discord successfully. (07-02)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `--threshold N` flag to `cron-check` to override default 14d staleness threshold — parses `--threshold N` (positive int, days), validates input, passes to freshness filter. Tested: `--threshold 999` skips wake, `--threshold 5` correctly wakes stalest category (bruh, 17.3d). Error handling for invalid/missing/zero values. Updated usage text + case dispatch to forward args. (07-02)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `--dry-run` flag to `cron-check` — shows what auto-wake would do without sending. Parses `--dry-run` in any position alongside `--threshold N`. Outputs `🧪 [DRY-RUN] Would auto-wake: <cat> (<days>d stale)` instead of actually sending. Updated usage text. Tested: dry-run only, dry-run+threshold combo, threshold+dry-run order. (07-02)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add contextual category awareness to freshness/review — greeting-morning/night/hello/bye now use 14d staleness threshold (vs 7d for general). Added MEMES_CONTEXTUAL_CATS array + _is_contextual_cat() helper. JSON includes contextual flag. Stale count 12→8, less noise. (07-03)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes retire <source> <target>` command — merges a category into another: moves files (with collision prefix), re-keys tags.json + _styles via rename map, rewrites tracker history/counts, removes empty source dir. Supports `--dry-run`. Tested: normal merge, name collision, alias resolution, error cases (nonexistent/same category). Fixed `((moved++))` with set -e, fixed `startswith('_')` filter excluding valid category keys. (07-03)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `memes dedup` command — finds exact-duplicate files (md5) across/within categories. Dry-run by default, `--fix` removes same-category dupes (merges tags into survivor, rewrites tracker history, updates categoryCounts). Cross-category dupes reported but preserved (different semantic contexts). Tested: found 9 groups (5 same-cat, 4 cross-cat), removed 6 same-cat dupes, saved ~5MB, 243→237 files. Coverage still 100%. (07-03)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add perceptual hash (pHash) near-duplicate detection to `memes dedup` — `--phash` flag uses Python imagehash library to compute perceptual hashes for all 237 meme files, groups visually similar images by hamming distance (default threshold ≤10, configurable via `--threshold N`). Same-category near-dupes → auto-removable with `--fix` (reuses exact-dedup's tags.json + tracker merge logic). Cross-category near-dupes reported but preserved. Handles GIF first-frame extraction, broken file graceful fallback. Display script uses heredoc to avoid Python 3.12 f-string `\"` quoting issue in bash single-quoted strings. Found: 22 groups (12 same-cat removable, ~6.8MB savings). (07-04)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Audit cross-category pHash duplicates — reviewed all 10 cross-cat pHash groups. 4 groups were exact md5 dupes (same file, different name): consolidated 5 files into semantic-best category (confused/squint←thinking/math-lady, cute-animals/cat-curious←tired/exhausted-cat+wow/impressed, working/office-hustle←cute-animals/keyboard-cat, panic/fire←tired/face-desk). 6 groups were perceptually similar but genuinely different files — left untouched. Also ran same-cat pHash dedup --fix (14 more removed). Fixed dedup --fix bug (used `rm` instead of `git rm`, files deleted from disk but not staged). 237→218 files total. Tags merged into all survivors. (07-04)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Fix `working/focus.gif` pHash crash — root cause: `img.n_frames` internally seeks all GIF frames, hitting corrupt frame 22 → IndexError. Fixed `_dedup_phash()` with inner try/except to fallback to `seek(0)`. This unblocked hashing, which revealed focus.gif is pHash-identical to coffee-work.gif (dist=0). Deduped: removed focus.gif (988KB, corrupt), merged tags into coffee-work.gif (339KB, clean). 218→217 files. (07-05)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Split stale count into general vs contextual in review/freshness — `_review_freshness_summary()` now shows "7 general + 3 contextual" instead of lumped "10/26 stale". Top-3 stalest prioritizes general over contextual. `cmd_freshness` table footer matches. Tracker `lastReview.freshness` includes `generalStale`/`contextualStale`. More actionable: contextual staleness (greetings) is expected, general is the real signal. (07-16)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Improve `disappointed` style diversity — was already fixed (4 styles: 6 anime + 3 live-action + 1 meme + 1 cartoon, 58% anime). Task was stale. (07-16)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add anime style to `sad` category — had 0 anime (3 animal + 2 meme + 1 cartoon). Added frieren-sad.gif (185KB, 438×480, Frieren chibi). Now 4 styles across 7 files. No pHash dupes. (07-16)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `--auto-wake` flag to `memes review` — auto-sends stalest general category (>14d) when coverage is clean. Also fixed `_send_err_file` RETURN trap unbound variable bug (used `${_send_err_file:-}` guard). Tested: correctly identifies stalest general category, sends to Discord, updates tracker. Now the 3x-daily review cron can self-heal staleness. (07-17)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add anime style to `thanks` category — had 4 meme + 2 animal + 1 anime. Added pokemon-happy-cry.gif (1046KB, 480x364, Pokémon happy crying/tears of joy). Now 4 meme + 2 animal + 2 anime across 8 files. 3 styles, coverage 100%. Also found pre-existing same-cat dupe in thinking/ (anime-thinking = spongebob-thinking). (07-17)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Fix same-cat duplicate in `thinking` category — anime-thinking.gif exact md5 dupe of spongebob-thinking.gif. Ran `memes dedup --fix`: merged tags, rewritten history entries, deleted dupe. thinking/ 7→6 files, coverage 100%. (07-17)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Wake stale categories — all 7/26 stale categories woken via dormant-blast (greeting-night, greeting-hello, sad, waiting, popcorn, greeting-morning, confused, encourage). Freshness now 0/26 stale. 8 memes sent to Discord. (07-18)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Fix `memes wake <category>` argument ignored bug — root cause: `*) shift ;;` in arg parser discarded positional args. Fixed: capture positional as `target_cat`, validate directory exists, skip dormant-search when specified. Tested: `wake sad` → sad, `wake` → stalest (debug-mood), `wake nonexistent` → error. (07-18)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add usage/help text to `memes wake` — added `--help` handler with full usage, options, examples. Also added `wake` + `dormant-blast` to main `memes` usage text (were missing). Tested: `--help`, auto-stalest, specific category, error on nonexistent all work. (07-18)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Fix `memes wake` misleading pick-only output — without `--send`, showed "💤 Waking dormant category" implying action was taken, but only picked a file. Changed to "🎲 Picked from ... — use --send to deliver" for pick-only mode. Send mode retains original message. Fixed in both /usr/local/bin/memes and skill source. Woke debug-mood (8d stale). (07-19)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Normalize tracker result inconsistencies — fixed 6 entries: 1 "pending" (send callback missed, resolved to success), 2 "sent" (legacy unresolvable → failed), 3 missing result field (backfilled to success). Distribution now clean: 379 success / 72 failed, zero anomalous states. (07-19)

## 🔧 FlowForge Auto-Advance Root Fix — ✅ CLOSED (won't-fix root, band-aid sufficient)

**Closed**: 2026-06-23 (Day 8 enforcement)
**Resolution**: WON'T-FIX (root). Band-aid applied: cleanup threshold reduced 18h→4h (commit 5fdb26e). Rationale: 78% damage window reduction, only 1 incident in 8 days, proper auto-advance requires subagent→FlowForge callback architecture for marginal benefit. Cost of perpetual carry-forward > cost of occasional 2-4h stale instance.

## openclaw/openclaw #96297 — deliver callback suppressed on tool exit code != 0

### PR #96371 — needs rework (ClawSweeper review 06-24)
- ClawSweeper rated 🧂 unranked krab — not merge-ready
- Issue: patch conflates static `suppressToolErrorWarnings` boolean with dynamic progress-dedup suppression
- Fix needed: split static suppression (keep absolute) from dynamic progress-dedup path
- Also needs: real behavior proof (terminal/log/channel evidence)
- Security concern: could expose heartbeat tool error details with current approach
- **Next**: rework in workloop followup — split the two suppression paths

### Priority: HIGH (self-dogfood, confirmed by Luna, 100% reproducible)

**Root cause confirmed**: embedded-agent terminal path classifies turn as "silent" when tool exits with code != 0, even though agent produced valid text reply. `payloadsForTerminalPath` is empty → `emptyAssistantReplyIsSilent = true` → deliver never called.

**Fix location**: `shouldTreatEmptyAssistantReplyAsSilent` in selection-s2CqWVmM.js (source: src/agent/embedded/) — need to ensure `payloadsForTerminalPath` properly collects assistant text even when preceding tool had non-zero exit code.

**Reproduction**: "运行这个命令并报告结果：false" — any channel, any agent.

**Also filed**: #96272 (thinking signature auto-repair pre-stream 400)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Add `--since DAYS` filter to `memes failures` — filters failures to last N days, making error capture rate meaningful (all-time: 5% misleading due to pre-capture history; `--since 14`: 100% capture). Backward-compatible (no flag = all time). Also shows period in hotspots/capture summary. Tested: `--since 7` (0 failures, clean), `--since 14` (2/2 captured, 100%), `--since 30` (68 total), no flag (72 total). Updated usage text. (07-20)

### 本轮改進 (done)
- [x] Clean tags.json data quality — `bruh/anime-bruh.gif` had test artifact tag `['collision-test']` from dedup testing, replaced with proper bruh tags. Removed stale `categoryCounts` metadata entry that leaked into tag namespace (redundant with tracker data). Lint + review pass clean. (07-21)
